Start by opening up a terminal window.

Now we much make and build the ARM image using the Rootstock command.

The Rootstock program has alot of variables for this guide you will want to type the command as follows:

sudo rootstock --fqdn ubuntu --login ubuntu --password ubuntu --imagesize 4G --seed linux-image-omap,build-essential,mysql-server,tightvncserver,lxde,mysql-server-core-5.1,mysql-server-5.1,libmysqlclient16,mysql-common,mysql-client-core-5.1 

Lets look through each part of this command so you can understand what's going on.

--login and --password, these set the login information for the image, you can use this user to boot without root if you wanted.

--imagesize 4G This sets up the size of the image in GB ie 3.5GB would be 3.5G. 
--seed This is where you set what packages you wish installed with the image, you will need linux-image-omap and build-essential to have it boot, any other images is up to you (but if you want a UI you will need to install one and a VNC program!)
