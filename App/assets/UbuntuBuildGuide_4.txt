Now we will mount the empty image file to directory /mnt:

sudo mount -o loop ubuntu.img /mnt

And then uncompress the ARM image we made into the /mnt directory:

sudo tar -C /mnt -zxf armel-rootfs-200904151837.tgz
(Of cause the armel-rootfs-200904151837.tgz will be replaced with what ever you image is called).

Once all the files are copied over, we unmount the image file and you have your very own build of Ubuntu to copy to your device!

sudo umount /mnt

You will still need to use my boot script, and services like VNC will not start on boot up, as there is a script in my images that does this(it can be found at root/inti.sh if you wish to use it).
