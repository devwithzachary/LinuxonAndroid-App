This guide will take you through building your own Ubuntu images, so you can set your own image size, and include different programs etc.

Before you start you need to have a computer running Ubuntu 9.10 or newer (this could be via a virtual machine if you do not have a install already).

Once you have a Ubuntu machine to work in, fire it up and press next.
