After running this command you should end up with a file like armel-rootfs-201101311759.tgz with the datestamp of the time you ran the command.

We now need to take this file and load it into a .img file.

To do this we need to make an empty image file with command dd:

dd if=/dev/zero of=ubuntu.img bs=1MB count=0 seek=4096

To set the size of the image change the seek to the size you set in the rootstock command.

Next format the image to ext2 using:\nmke2fs -F ubuntu.img
